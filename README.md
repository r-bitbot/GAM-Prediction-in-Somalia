# Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) Prediction in Somalia
This project aims to predict the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence in Somalia using machine learning methods. Leveraging data from Somalia Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) for district level forecasting of global acute malnutrition. The goal is to provide insights for actionable intervention and prepare for rises in GAM.

## Objectives

## Datasets Used
* From FSNAU, the datasets of [GAM](https://dashboard.fsnau.org/nutrition/gam), [rainfall](https://dashboard.fsnau.org/climate/rainfall), [NDVI](https://dashboard.fsnau.org/climate/ndvi), [incidents](https://dashboard.fsnau.org/insecurity/incidents), [fatalities](https://dashboard.fsnau.org/insecurity/fatalities), and [crops](https://crops.fsnau.org/) were taken from the duration of January 2017 to December 2019.

## To Run Locally
The project is designed for local Jupyter Notebook executiom. To run it locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/r-bitbot/GAM-Prediction-in-Somalia.git
cd GAM-Prediction-in-Somalia
jupyter notebook
```
Ensure you have all the libraries installed (via pip or conda).

## Tools and Libraries Used
* Python 3.7 and above
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning
* numpy: For numerical operations
* scikit-learn: For machine learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
* matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization
* requests and urllib: For data fetching from FSNAU APIs

## Methodology
### Data Collection
Data was collected manually from the FSNAU site.
